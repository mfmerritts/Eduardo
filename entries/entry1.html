    The basics of html. At it's most fundemental level it's actually pretty intuitive. &lt &rt creats a tag, the type of which is indicated by easy to remember name or meaningful abbreviation. I can do cute things like make a word <b>bold</b> or <i>italicized</i> and insert links. I don't know anything super amazing yet though.
